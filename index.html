<div id="aboutme"><p>I am a passionate programmer and enjoy learning new concepts and exploring
new developments in the ICT industry to help me stay on cutting edge and to ensure that i give my clients the best that technology has to offer.</p>
<br/><b>Education:</b> Certificate Secondary School.
<br/><b>Job Experience :</b> Clerical Data entry work for Nasadiki Ltd.
<br/><b>Why  :</b>I decided to take a course in programming because i realised that my passion is creating ideas i envision and the current situation was i couldnt
get a programmer who would do exactly as i was seeing the idea in my mind so i decided to learn and be able to translate my vision to code.
